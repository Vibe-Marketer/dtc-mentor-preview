# The $100M DTC Playbook

## How Liquid Death, OLIPOP, Jolie, and Jones Road Built 9-Figure Brands

---

# Introduction: The New Rules

The playbook that built DTC brands from 2015-2020 is dead.

Facebook CPMs are up 300%. iOS 14.5 killed attribution. Every brand looks the same. The arbitrage is over.

But four brands didn't just survive — they became household names while most DTC brands died quietly.

**Liquid Death:** $1.4B valuation selling water in cans.
**OLIPOP:** $500M+ revenue in year 5, valued at $1.85B.
**Jolie:** $0 to $28M in 2 years selling shower heads.
**Jones Road:** $100M+ in 3 years, bootstrapped.

This playbook breaks down exactly how they did it. No theory. Real tactics. Real numbers.

# Chapter 1: Liquid Death
## How to Build a $1.4B Brand Selling Commoditized Water

### The Insight
Mike Cessario worked in advertising and noticed something: energy drink brands had incredible marketing — skull logos, extreme sports, rebellious vibes — but the products were terrible for you.

Water was the opposite: healthy product, boring marketing.

**The gap:** What if you marketed water like a death metal energy drink?

### The Numbers
- **Year 1 revenue:** $2.8M
- **2023 revenue:** $263M
- **Current valuation:** $1.4B (March 2024)
- **Retail locations:** 113,000+
- **Marketing spend:** 10% of revenue allocated to brand (not performance)

### The 5 Tactics That Built Liquid Death

#### 1. Category Disruption Through Packaging
Liquid Death chose tallboy aluminum cans — the same format as beer. This wasn't random:
- **Instantly different** from every water brand on the shelf
- **Socially acceptable** to hold at bars/concerts (looks like beer)
- **Sustainable angle** (infinitely recyclable aluminum)
- **Premium price justification** ($1.89 vs $0.99 plastic bottle)

**Tactic:** Find the packaging convention in your category and violate it intentionally.

#### 2. Brand Investment as a Non-Negotiable
From day one, Liquid Death allocated 10% of all revenue to brand marketing — regardless of what the spreadsheet said.

This funded campaigns like:
- Super Bowl ad parody videos
- Selling their "soul" program ($1.80 per soul to ocean cleanup)
- Death metal albums featuring real artists
- Partnerships with Tony Hawk, Travis Barker, Martha Stewart

**Tactic:** Set aside a fixed % for brand before you calculate margins. Protect it like payroll.

#### 3. Entertainment Over Advertising
Liquid Death doesn't run ads. They create content so good people share it voluntarily.

Examples:
- "Greatest Hates" album featuring hate comments set to death metal
- Mock infomercials for water
- Skateboard decks made from discarded cans

Their TikTok and YouTube have billions of organic views. They're not competing with other water brands — they're competing with Netflix for attention.

**Tactic:** Ask "would someone share this if we didn't pay them?" If no, don't make it.

#### 4. Strategic Distribution = Lifestyle Placement
Liquid Death partnered with Live Nation to be the official water of concerts and festivals. They're not in the water aisle at grocery stores — they're in:
- Concert venues
- 7-Eleven (next to beer)
- Tattoo shops
- Gyms
- Whole Foods

**Tactic:** Go where your customer is expressing the identity your brand represents.

#### 5. Mission as Marketing
"Death to Plastic" isn't just a tagline — it's a business model. They donate to ocean cleanup, use only recyclable materials, and make sustainability core to the brand story.

This attracts:
- Free press (journalists love writing about sustainability)
- Partnership opportunities (brands want to align)
- Customer loyalty (people feel good about buying)

**Tactic:** Pick a real cause, make it central, and actually do something about it.

### Key Takeaway
Liquid Death proved you can build a billion-dollar brand in the most commoditized category imaginable — if you stop competing on product and start competing on attention.

# Chapter 2: OLIPOP
## From Farmers Markets to $500M Revenue in 5 Years

### The Insight
Ben Goodwin spent 15 years trying to make a healthy soda that didn't taste like medicine. After several failed attempts (including a brand called Obi Probiotic Soda), he finally cracked the formula with OLIPOP in 2018.

**The gap:** Gut health was exploding, but functional beverages tasted terrible. What if a soda was both delicious AND healthy?

### The Numbers
- **Year 1 revenue (2018):** $852,000
- **2023 revenue:** ~$200M
- **2024 projected:** $500M
- **Current valuation:** $1.85B
- **Retail locations:** 50,000+
- **Initial investment:** $100,000

### The 5 Tactics That Built OLIPOP

#### 1. Obsessive Product Development (15 Years)
Before OLIPOP, Goodwin spent 15 years iterating on formulas. He understood that functional beverages fail because they taste functional.

OLIPOP's breakthrough: It tastes like actual soda. Not "healthy soda." Soda.

Flavors like Vintage Cola, Cherry Vanilla, and Strawberry Vanilla directly mimic nostalgic soda experiences while delivering 9g of fiber and prebiotics.

**Tactic:** Don't launch until the product is genuinely better, not just "better for you."

#### 2. Strategic Retail Expansion
OLIPOP didn't rush into retail. Their sequence:
1. **2018:** 40 Northern California grocery stores
2. **2019:** Regional chains (Sprouts, natural grocers)
3. **2020:** Target and Walmart nationally
4. **2023:** Costco, Starbucks, every major chain

At each stage, they built proof of velocity before approaching the next tier.

**Tactic:** Win your current retail tier before pitching the next one. Buyers want velocity data.

#### 3. Social Media as Science Experiment
OLIPOP treats social content like a lab. They test constantly:
- Which flavors drive the most UGC
- Which creators convert vs. just drive awareness
- Which formats perform (taste tests, gut health education, nostalgia plays)

Their TikTok exploded when they leaned into the nostalgia angle — recreating childhood soda experiences, taste-testing against legacy brands.

**Tactic:** Track which content types drive actual sales, not just engagement.

#### 4. Subscription Model for Consumables
OLIPOP offers subscribe-and-save at 15% off. For a consumable product with high repeat potential, this:
- Increases LTV dramatically
- Creates predictable revenue
- Reduces reliance on paid acquisition

Their subscription rate is significantly higher than typical beverage brands because they marketed it aggressively from launch.

**Tactic:** If your product is consumable, make subscription the default, not an afterthought.

#### 5. Investor-as-Distribution
OLIPOP's investors include Camila Cabello, Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas, Joe Jonas, Kevin Jonas, and Gwyneth Paltrow. These aren't just checks — they're distribution channels.

Each celebrity investor posts about the product, giving OLIPOP access to tens of millions of followers.

**Tactic:** Choose investors who can open doors, not just write checks.

### Key Takeaway
OLIPOP proved that category creation (healthy soda) can work — but only if the product genuinely delivers on the promise. They spent 15 years on R&D before spending $1 on marketing.

# Chapter 3: Jolie
## $0 to $28M in 2 Years With Almost No Paid Ads

### The Insight
Ryan Babenzien (founder of Greats sneakers) was looking for a one-size-fits-all product after dealing with the logistics nightmare of shoes. He noticed his dry skin was getting worse and traced it to water quality.

**The gap:** The beauty industry sells products to fix skin problems caused by water. What if you just fixed the water?

### The Numbers
- **Year 1 revenue (2022):** $4M
- **Year 2 revenue (2023):** $28M
- **Total raised:** $2M (barely touched it)
- **UGC videos created:** 25,000+
- **Paid ad spend:** Near zero
- **Profitable:** From day one

### The 5 Tactics That Built Jolie

#### 1. Category Repositioning
Jolie didn't enter the "shower head" category. They entered the "beauty" category.

This matters because:
- Shower heads are a $40 Home Depot commodity
- Beauty products command premium prices and emotional loyalty
- The audience is completely different (beauty consumers vs. DIY homeowners)

Their tagline: "Step Zero in your beauty routine."

**Tactic:** Choose your competitive set strategically. Same product, different positioning = different business.

#### 2. Manual UGC Seeding at Scale
Jolie's team manually reached out to hundreds of creators with a simple offer: free shower head for an honest review.

The key word is "manual." No influencer platforms. No automated outreach. Personal DMs and emails, one by one.

After the first few hundred posted, organic creators started making videos without being asked. The flywheel kicked in.

Result: 25,000+ UGC videos in 2 years. Search "Jolie showerhead" on TikTok — first three results have 3M+ combined views.

**Tactic:** Seed UGC manually until it becomes self-sustaining. Most brands give up too early.

#### 3. Unmeasurable Marketing That Works
Ryan's most controversial stance: the unmeasured marketing is more valuable than the measured marketing.

Jolie ran wrapped delivery trucks around NYC with the message: "What if we told you your shower water was dirtier than this truck?"

Can they measure exactly how many sales came from it? No.
Did it generate massive social sharing, press coverage, and word of mouth? Yes.

**Tactic:** Allocate budget to creative brand marketing that can't be attributed. Trust that it lifts everything.

#### 4. No Discounts, Ever
Jolie has never run a discount — not even on Black Friday.

Ryan's reasoning: "Customers who receive a discount before experiencing the brand expect a discount every time. It diminishes perceived value and teaches them to wait for sales."

The result: Customers pay full price because they believe Jolie is premium and worth it.

**Tactic:** If you want to be a premium brand, act like one from day one. Discounts are a one-way door.

#### 5. Margin-First Pricing
Most founders price based on competitors. Ryan priced based on margin requirements.

He knew Jolie would eventually need to be in retail (wholesale margins are ~50%). So he priced the product high enough to support omnichannel from the start.

"If your price is higher than competition, so be it. Your margin structure has to support the business you want to build."

**Tactic:** Price for your target margin structure, not your competitor's price points.

### Key Takeaway
Jolie proved that paid marketing isn't required if you nail product, positioning, and word of mouth. They built a $28M brand on UGC and brand marketing alone.

# Chapter 4: Jones Road Beauty
## $100M in 3 Years by Breaking Every DTC Rule

### The Insight
Bobbi Brown sold her namesake brand to Estée Lauder in 1995, stayed for 20 years, and left in 2016 when it no longer aligned with her vision. In 2020, at 63, she launched Jones Road with a different philosophy: less makeup, more skin.

**The gap:** The beauty industry pushes full coverage. Women over 40 want to look better, not more made up.

### The Numbers
- **Year 1 revenue (2020):** $20M
- **Year 2 revenue (2022):** $60M
- **Year 3 revenue (2023):** $100M+
- **Email subscribers:** 1M+
- **TikTok followers:** 500K+
- **Ad spend:** ~$150-200K/month
- **Funding:** Bootstrapped

### The 5 Tactics That Built Jones Road

#### 1. Founder as Content Engine
Bobbi Brown isn't the face of Jones Road — she IS Jones Road.

She posts multiple times daily on TikTok and Instagram:
- Morning routines in her bathroom
- Product demos with no filters
- Responding to criticism directly
- Teaching application techniques

She answers DMs. Comments on customer videos. Thanks people for honest feedback.

This creates trust that no campaign can manufacture.

**Tactic:** If you have founder credibility, use it. Get on camera daily.

#### 2. Turning Controversy into Sales
When TikTok creator Meredith Duxbury posted a negative review of Jones Road's "What The Foundation" — applying it wrong and calling it greasy — the video went viral with millions of critical views.

Bobbi's response: a calm, stitched video showing the correct application method. No defensiveness. No attacking the creator.

That response went viral too. Then hundreds of creators posted comparison videos. Sales quadrupled. WTF became their #1 product.

**Tactic:** Negative viral moments are opportunities. Respond with helpfulness, not defensiveness.

#### 3. Education Over Promotion
Jones Road emails don't say "BUY NOW 20% OFF." They say:
- "Not sure how to use Miracle Balm? Here's a 2-minute guide."
- "Your most asked questions, answered by Bobbi."
- "The mistake you're making with foundation (and the fix)."

Results:
- Email open rates: 30-35% (industry average: 15-20%)
- BFCM 2023: Email drove 38.4% of total revenue
- Product popup submit rate: 59.2%

**Tactic:** Teach first, sell second. Educated customers buy more and return less.

#### 4. Minimal SKUs, Maximum Focus
Jones Road launched with 6 products. Period.

While competitors launch 50+ SKUs to fill shelf space, Jones Road went deep instead of wide:
- Miracle Balm
- What The Foundation
- Face Pencil
- A few supporting products

This creates:
- Lower inventory risk
- Clearer customer decisions
- Stronger hero product focus
- Higher repeat purchases on core items

**Tactic:** Launch with fewer products than you think you need. Let winners emerge before expanding.

#### 5. CX Automation That Scales
Despite the personal brand feel, Jones Road is highly automated behind the scenes.

After implementing Richpanel for customer support:
- 46% of tickets resolved via automation
- 14% increase in post-support conversions
- $1.5M in incremental revenue in two weeks

The front-end feels human. The back-end scales.

**Tactic:** Automate operations aggressively so you can afford to be personal where it matters.

### Key Takeaway
Jones Road proved that founder-led brands have an unfair advantage — but only if the founder actually leads. Bobbi Brown didn't delegate content. She IS the content.

# The Common Threads

## 1. Product-Market Fit Before Marketing
All four brands had products that genuinely worked before they scaled marketing. Liquid Death's water was premium quality. OLIPOP actually tastes good. Jolie actually improves skin/hair. Jones Road actually makes you look better with less.

## 2. Brand Investment as a Fixed Expense
None of these brands treated brand as optional. They allocated budget to unmeasurable marketing — creative campaigns, events, PR, organic content — and protected it.

## 3. Community, Not Customers
Each brand built evangelists, not just buyers. People who wear Liquid Death merch. People who gift OLIPOP. People who make TikToks about Jolie. People who defend Bobbi Brown in comments.

## 4. Founder Involvement
Mike Cessario still approves every creative. Ben Goodwin still develops flavors. Ryan Babenzien still runs Jolie's strategy. Bobbi Brown still posts content daily. These aren't absentee founders.

## 5. Patience
Liquid Death spent years building brand before scaling distribution. OLIPOP's founder spent 15 years on R&D. Jolie built UGC for a year before it became self-sustaining. Jones Road resisted the urge to launch more SKUs.

# Your Action Items

## Audit Your Current State
- [ ] Is your product genuinely differentiated, or are you competing on marketing?
- [ ] Are you allocating budget to brand, or just performance?
- [ ] Do customers talk about you without being paid?
- [ ] Are you visible as a founder, or hiding behind the logo?

## This Week
1. **Set your brand budget.** Pick a % of revenue (5-10%) and protect it.
2. **Identify 50 creators** who would genuinely benefit from your product. Reach out manually.
3. **Create one piece of founder content.** Just one video, one post. Start.
4. **Look at your pricing.** Does it support wholesale margins? If not, raise it.

## This Month
1. **Find your "tallboy can."** What convention in your category could you violate?
2. **Build one unmeasurable campaign.** Something creative that can't be attributed but will be talked about.
3. **Talk to 10 customers.** Not surveys. Actual conversations. What language do they use?

## This Quarter
1. **Track UGC velocity.** How many organic posts are people making about you monthly?
2. **Measure repeat rate.** Are you building loyalty or renting attention?
3. **Calculate true LTV:CAC.** With all costs included. Are you actually profitable?

# Final Word

These four brands didn't follow the "DTC playbook" because that playbook was written for a different era.

They built actual brands with genuine products and real communities.

The tactics are all here. The question is: will you actually do them?
