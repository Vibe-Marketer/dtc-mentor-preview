# Amazon FBA & Marketplace Playbook

## Platform Overview

### Why Amazon
- 300M+ active customer accounts
- 60% of US ecommerce product searches start on Amazon (not Google)
- Built-in trust and Prime shipping
- Search-driven intent (people come to BUY)

### Amazon vs DTC vs TikTok Shop
| Factor | Amazon | DTC (Shopify) | TikTok Shop |
|--------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Customer ownership | NO | YES | Partial |
| Discovery method | Search | Paid ads/social | Algorithm |
| Trust building | Amazon handles | You build | Platform handles |
| Margins | Lower (fees) | Higher | Medium |
| Repeat purchase data | Limited | Full | Limited |
| Brand control | Moderate | Full | Low |

**Bottom line:** Amazon is a sales CHANNEL, not a brand-building platform. Use for volume. Build brand on DTC.

## Fee Structure (FBA vs FBM)

### FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon)
Amazon stores, picks, packs, ships your product.

**Fee components:**
1. **Referral fee:** 8-15% depending on category (most categories 15%)
2. **FBA fulfillment fee:** Based on size/weight
   - Small standard (< 1 lb): $3.22
   - Large standard (1-2 lb): $4.75-$5.79
   - Large standard (2-3 lb): $6.05-$7.17
3. **Storage fee:** $0.87/cubic ft (Jan-Sept), $2.40/cubic ft (Oct-Dec)
4. **Optional fees:** Removal, disposal, long-term storage (365+ days = $6.90/cubic ft)

**Example calculation (beauty product):**
- Selling price: $29.99
- Referral fee (15%): $4.50
- FBA fee (small standard): $3.22
- Storage (minimal): $0.10
- **Total Amazon fees: $7.82 (26%)**
- COGS: $6.00 (20%)
- **Contribution margin: $16.17 (54%)**

### FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant)
You handle storage and shipping.

**When FBM makes sense:**
- Very large/heavy items
- High-value items needing special handling
- Products with long sales cycles
- Testing before committing to FBA inventory

**FBM challenges:**
- No Prime badge (huge conversion impact)
- Seller-Fulfilled Prime is very hard to qualify for
- You handle returns

## Amazon PPC (Advertising)

### Campaign Types

**1. Sponsored Products (start here)**
- Appear in search results and product pages
- Target keywords or products
- Best for driving sales and ranking

**2. Sponsored Brands**
- Banner ads at top of search
- Feature your logo and multiple products
- Best for brand awareness

**3. Sponsored Display**
- On and off Amazon retargeting
- Target audiences or products
- Best for remarketing

### PPC Strategy for New Products

**Phase 1: Research (before launch)**
- Use Helium 10, Jungle Scout, or Amazon's Brand Analytics
- Identify 20-50 relevant keywords
- Categorize: high volume (>1000/mo), medium (300-1000), long-tail (<300)
- Note competitor ASINs for product targeting

**Phase 2: Launch (weeks 1-4)**
- Auto campaign at $20-30/day (let Amazon find keywords)
- Manual exact match on top 10 keywords
- Product targeting on top 5 competitor ASINs
- Bid high initially (2x suggested bid) to get impressions
- Goal: generate reviews, find winning keywords

**Phase 3: Optimize (weeks 5-12)**
- Pull search term report weekly
- Move winning keywords from auto to manual exact
- Add negative keywords for irrelevant terms
- Lower bids on low-converting keywords
- Scale what's working

**Phase 4: Scale (month 3+)**
- Broad and phrase match on winning terms
- Expand Sponsored Brands
- Add Sponsored Display for retargeting
- Test video ads (if available)

### PPC Benchmarks
| Metric | Average | Good | Excellent |
|--------|---------|------|-----------|
| ACoS | 25-35% | 15-25% | <15% |
| TACoS | 8-12% | 5-8% | <5% |
| CTR | 0.3-0.5% | 0.5-0.8% | >0.8% |
| CVR | 8-12% | 12-20% | >20% |

**Key formulas:**
- ACoS = Ad Spend / Ad Revenue
- TACoS = Ad Spend / Total Revenue (including organic)
- Breakeven ACoS = Profit Margin %

## Listing Optimization

### Title Formula
[Brand] + [Product Type] + [Key Features] + [Size/Quantity] + [Benefit]

**Example:**
"Ridge Wallet - Minimalist RFID Blocking Metal Wallet for Men - Slim Front Pocket Card Holder - Titanium Gunmetal"

**Rules:**
- 150-200 characters (category dependent)
- Most important keywords first
- No ALL CAPS, no promotional language
- Include brand name

### Bullet Points
5 bullets, each 200-250 characters

**Structure each bullet:**
- Start with BENEFIT (capitalized)
- Follow with feature that delivers benefit
- End with proof/detail

**Example:**
"ULTRA SLIM DESIGN - Fits comfortably in front pocket. Holds 1-12 cards plus cash strap. Replaces bulky traditional wallets without sacrificing capacity."

### Product Description / A+ Content
If Brand Registered, use A+ Content (Enhanced Brand Content):
- Comparison charts
- Lifestyle images with text
- Feature callouts
- Brand story module

**A+ Content impact:** 3-10% conversion lift typical

### Backend Keywords
- 250 bytes of hidden keywords
- No commas needed (just spaces)
- No brand names (competitors)
- Include misspellings, Spanish terms if relevant
- Don't repeat words already in title/bullets

### Image Strategy
**Image 1 (Main):** White background, product only, fills 85%+ of frame
**Image 2:** Lifestyle/in-use shot
**Image 3:** Size comparison or scale
**Image 4:** Key feature closeup
**Image 5:** Infographic with features/benefits
**Image 6:** What's in the box / contents
**Image 7:** Lifestyle shot 2 or comparison chart

**Video:** If eligible, add demo video (huge conversion boost)

## Reviews Strategy

### Getting First Reviews (Legitimately)

**1. Amazon Vine Program**
- Enroll new ASINs with <30 reviews
- Send up to 30 free units to Vine reviewers
- Cost: Product COGS only (no fee currently for FBA products)
- Reviews marked "Vine Voice"

**2. Request a Review Button**
- Available in Seller Central
- Amazon sends templated review request
- Can request 5-30 days after delivery
- More effective than custom emails

**3. Product Inserts**
- DO: Ask for "feedback" generically
- DO: Direct to your website for support
- DON'T: Ask specifically for Amazon review
- DON'T: Offer incentives for reviews

**4. Follow-Up Sequences**
- Tools: FeedbackWhiz, Jungle Scout, SellerLabs
- Send automated requests at optimal timing
- Track and optimize timing

### Review Velocity Benchmarks
- Week 1-4: 5-10 reviews minimum to start ranking
- Month 2-3: 25-50 reviews for credibility
- Month 6+: 100+ reviews for category competitiveness

## Multi-Channel Strategy: Amazon + DTC + TikTok Shop

### Channel Roles
- **Amazon:** Volume, new customer acquisition via search, credibility
- **DTC (Shopify):** Margin, brand building, customer data, retention
- **TikTok Shop:** Discovery, viral potential, younger demos

### Avoiding Cannibalization

**Pricing strategy:**
- Same price across channels (MAP policy)
- OR slightly higher on Amazon (offset fees with convenience value)
- Bundle exclusives by channel

**Product strategy:**
- Amazon: Core SKUs, proven winners
- DTC: Full catalog, exclusives, limited editions
- TikTok Shop: Trending items, kits/bundles, lower AOV entry points

**Customer journey:**
- Amazon → builds trust, proves product
- Discovery customers → Amazon
- Retention customers → DTC
- TikTok → discovery → Amazon or DTC depending on offer

### When to Expand to Amazon (from DTC/TTS)
- Product-market fit proven (consistent sales)
- Margins support 25-30% Amazon fee load
- Inventory depth available
- Ready to commit 6-12 months (ranking takes time)
- Brand trademark secured

### When to Expand from Amazon (to DTC)
- Strong reviews and social proof to leverage
- Customer acquisition proven
- Want higher margins and customer data
- Ready to invest in paid acquisition
