# Advanced DTC Tactics

## Facebook/Meta Ads Deep Dive

### Audience Testing Framework
**Week 1-2: Discovery**
- 5-10 different interest stacks ($20-30/day each)
- 2-3 lookalike audiences (1%, 3%, 5%)
- 1 broad (no targeting)
- Same creative across all to isolate audience performance

**Week 3-4: Validation**
- Kill anything with CPA 2x above target
- Scale winners by duplicating at 2x budget
- Test new creative on winning audiences

**Week 5+: Scaling**
- Winners get CBO campaigns
- Continuous creative testing
- Expand to new geos if domestic saturated

### Creative Testing Protocol
**Volume:** Minimum 3 new creatives per week
**Budget:** $50-100 per creative test
**Decision point:** After 2x target CPA spend

**What to test:**
1. Hook (first 3 seconds) - biggest impact
2. Format (static vs video vs carousel)
3. Length (15s vs 30s vs 60s)
4. Talent (founder vs customer vs influencer)
5. Angle (problem vs solution vs social proof)

**Creative scoring:**
- Thumbstop rate (3-sec views / impressions): Target 25%+
- Hold rate (watches to end): Target 15%+
- CTR: Target 1%+
- If thumbstop high but CTR low = hook works, body doesn't convert

### Retargeting Segments
**Hot (highest intent):**
- Add to cart 0-3 days: Aggressive, can offer discount
- Checkout initiated 0-7 days: Urgency messaging

**Warm:**
- Product viewers 0-7 days: Show viewed products
- Add to cart 4-14 days: Social proof heavy

**Cold retargeting:**
- Website visitors 8-30 days: Brand awareness
- Engaged 30-60 days: Seasonal or sale messaging

**Exclusions (critical):**
- Always exclude purchasers 0-7 days minimum
- Exclude email subscribers from cold prospecting
- Exclude high-frequency audiences (>3 impressions)

## Google Ads for DTC

### Campaign Types Ranked
1. **Brand Search** - Must have, protect your name
   - ROAS: 10-20x typical
   - Bid on brand + common misspellings
   
2. **Shopping (Standard + Performance Max)**
   - ROAS: 4-8x typical
   - Feed optimization critical
   - Use negative keywords aggressively
   
3. **Non-Brand Search**
   - ROAS: 2-4x typical
   - Category terms, problem-aware searches
   - Higher CPC but high intent
   
4. **YouTube**
   - Awareness and retargeting
   - Use for scaling once other channels maxed
   - Creative from Meta can work here

### Google Shopping Optimization
**Product titles:** [Brand] + [Product Type] + [Key Attribute] + [Size/Color]
Example: "Ridge Wallet Titanium Minimalist Wallet - Gunmetal"

**Product descriptions:** Feature keywords naturally, include benefits

**Images:** White background primary, lifestyle secondary

**Price competitiveness:** Google shows competitors, be aware

**Reviews:** Get Google Seller Ratings (100+ reviews needed)

### Performance Max Tips
- Give it 2-3 weeks to learn before judging
- Use audience signals (your email list, site visitors)
- Exclude brand terms if running separate brand campaign
- Check asset performance and replace underperformers
- Watch for YouTube eating budget inefficiently

## TikTok Ads Mastery

### Content That Works
1. **Native first** - Don't repurpose Meta ads
2. **Trends** - Use trending sounds and formats
3. **Speed** - Hook in 0.5-1 second (faster than Meta)
4. **Authenticity** - Polished = scrolled past
5. **Story** - Beginning, middle, end even in 15 seconds

### TikTok Creative Formats
**Talking head:** Creator speaks directly to camera
**Voiceover:** Product footage with narration
**Text overlay:** Trending audio + text storytelling
**Duet/Stitch:** React to other content
**Green screen:** Creator with product images behind

### Spark Ads vs Regular Ads
**Spark Ads:** Boost organic posts
- Higher engagement rates
- Comments stay on original post
- Better for brand building
- Requires creator partnership

**Regular Ads:** Traditional ad format
- More control over targeting
- Can use any creative
- Better for direct response
- No organic engagement benefit

### TikTok Shop Integration
- Highest conversion when product in TikTok Shop
- Enable "Shop Now" directly in feed
- Affiliate program for creators
- Live shopping for launches
- Commission typically 10-20% to creators

## Influencer Strategy at Scale

### Building a Creator Network
**Step 1:** Identify 50-100 potential creators
- Search hashtags in your niche
- Look at competitor partnerships
- Use platforms (Grin, CreatorIQ, Insense)

**Step 2:** Outreach sequence
- DM first (higher response than email)
- Personalize with specific content reference
- Clear ask: gifted product + potential paid

**Step 3:** Gifting tier
- Send product to 50 creators
- 20-30 will post organically
- 5-10 will become ongoing partners

**Step 4:** Paid partnerships
- Start with $200-500 flat fee
- Performance bonuses for views/sales
- Negotiate content rights for ads

### Influencer Brief Template
```
Brand: [Your brand]
Product: [Specific product to feature]
Key messages: [2-3 points to hit]
Do's: [What to include]
Don'ts: [What to avoid]
Deliverables: [1 video, 3 stories, etc.]
Timeline: [Due date]
Compensation: [Fee + product value]
Usage rights: [Organic only / Paid ads / Duration]
```

### Measuring Influencer ROI
**Direct attribution:**
- Unique discount codes per creator
- UTM links tracked in analytics
- Post-purchase survey "how did you hear about us"

**Indirect value:**
- Brand search lift during/after campaign
- Social following growth
- Content for paid ads (often most valuable)

**Benchmark:** Expect 2-5x ROI on total spend (including product)

## SMS Marketing Playbook

### Flow Setup Priority
1. **Welcome (after opt-in)**
   - Immediate: "Thanks for subscribing! Here's 10% off: [CODE]"
   
2. **Abandoned cart**
   - 30 min after: "Still thinking about [Product]? Here's your cart: [LINK]"
   - Don't overlap with email timing
   
3. **Shipping updates**
   - Shipped: "Your order is on the way! Track: [LINK]"
   - Delivered: "Your [Product] has arrived! Questions? Reply here"
   
4. **Post-purchase**
   - Day 3-5: "How are you liking [Product]? Reply and let us know!"

### Campaign Strategy
**Frequency:** 4-6 messages per month max
**Best days:** Tuesday-Thursday
**Best times:** 10am-12pm or 6pm-8pm local
**Character count:** Under 160 (avoid splitting)

**What to send:**
- Flash sales (24-48 hour only)
- Back in stock alerts
- New product drops
- VIP early access
- Holiday promos

**What NOT to send:**
- Regular newsletters (use email)
- Long educational content
- Frequent discounts (trains bad behavior)

### Compliance Essentials
- Double opt-in recommended
- Clear opt-out in every message (STOP)
- Only send 8am-9pm recipient's local time
- Keep records of consent
- Penalties: $500-$1,500 per violation (TCPA)

## Subscription Optimization

### Subscription Page Best Practices
- Default to subscription option (pre-selected)
- Show per-unit savings clearly
- Frequency options (30/60/90 days)
- Easy to understand cancellation policy
- Trust badges and testimonials

### Reducing Subscription Churn
**Passive churn (payment failures):**
- Use payment retry logic (Recharge, Stay AI have this)
- Send pre-dunning emails before card expires
- Offer alternative payment methods
- Target: Recover 30-50% of failed payments

**Active churn (cancellations):**
- Exit survey to understand why
- Offer alternatives: pause, skip, swap product
- Discount to stay (use sparingly)
- Win-back sequence for churned subscribers

### Subscription Metrics to Track
- Subscription rate: % of orders that are subscriptions
- Active subscriber count
- MRR (monthly recurring revenue)
- Churn rate (monthly)
- Average subscriber lifespan
- Subscriber LTV vs one-time buyer LTV

**Benchmarks:**
- Healthy churn: 8-12% monthly
- Good subscription rate: 30%+ of orders
- Average lifespan: 6-12 months
- Sub LTV should be 2-3x one-time LTV

## Landing Page Optimization

### Above the Fold Checklist
- [ ] Clear headline with main benefit
- [ ] Supporting subhead
- [ ] Hero image/video showing product in use
- [ ] Price visible
- [ ] Primary CTA button (contrasting color)
- [ ] Trust indicators (reviews, press logos)
- [ ] Mobile: All critical info visible without scrolling

### Page Structure (long-form)
1. **Hero:** Benefit-driven headline + CTA
2. **Problem:** Agitate the pain point
3. **Solution:** Introduce product as answer
4. **Features:** What it does (with benefits)
5. **Social proof:** Reviews, testimonials, UGC
6. **How it works:** Simple 3-step process
7. **FAQ:** Handle objections
8. **Final CTA:** Urgency + offer recap

### Conversion Killers
- Slow load time (>3 seconds = 40% bounce)
- No guest checkout option
- Surprise shipping costs at checkout
- Complicated navigation
- Stock photos instead of real product
- No mobile optimization
- Too many form fields

### A/B Testing Priority
Test in this order (highest impact first):
1. Headline and main value prop
2. Hero image/video
3. Price presentation
4. CTA button (color, text, placement)
5. Social proof placement
6. Page layout and length

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring Techniques
- Show "Compare at" price (crossed out)
- Display savings in dollars AND percentage
- Bundle pricing with individual item values shown
- "Most popular" badge on mid-tier option

### The Decoy Effect
When offering multiple options, add a "decoy" that makes your target option look better:

Example:
- Small: $29 (50ml)
- Medium: $49 (100ml) ← Target
- Large: $79 (120ml) ← Decoy (bad value makes medium look good)

### Free Shipping Psychology
- Threshold should be 30% above current AOV
- Show progress bar: "You're $12 away from FREE shipping!"
- Consider building shipping into product price
- "Free shipping over $X" converts better than "$X flat rate"

### Discount Strategy
- First purchase: 10-15% max (avoid training for discounts)
- Flash sales: 20-30% (creates urgency)
- Clearance: 40-50% (move dead inventory)
- Never discount hero product more than 20%
- Consider value-adds instead (free gift, bonus product)
