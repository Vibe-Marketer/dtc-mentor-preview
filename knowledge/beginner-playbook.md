# Beginner DTC Playbook: $0-$1K Ad Budget

## Reality Check: Starting with Limited Capital

### What $500-$1000/month Actually Gets You
- **At $500/month:** ~$16/day ad spend
- **At Meta's avg CPM ($12):** ~1,300 impressions/day
- **At 1% CTR:** ~13 clicks/day
- **At 3% conversion:** 0.4 sales/day = 12 sales/month

**The math doesn't work for cold ads at this budget.** Here's what to do instead.

---

## Phase 1: Validate Before Spending ($0)

### Do This First
1. **Prove demand exists:**
   - Search volume for your product (Google Keyword Planner)
   - Competitor sales (Jungle Scout, Similar Web)
   - Subreddit activity
   - TikTok hashtag views

2. **Prove YOU can sell it:**
   - List on Etsy, eBay, or Amazon as test
   - Post in Facebook groups (not spam — value first)
   - Run pre-orders to collect interest
   - DM potential customers directly

3. **Don't build elaborate website until you have sales proof**

### Minimum Viable Store
- 1-3 products max
- Simple theme (Dawn is free, works great)
- Basic product photos (phone + natural light + white poster board)
- Real copy — benefits, not features
- Email capture (even just pop-up + Klaviyo free tier)

---

## Phase 2: Free Traffic First ($0)

### TikTok Organic (Best ROI for $0)
**Posting strategy:**
- 1-3 posts per day
- Use trending sounds
- Hook in first 1 second
- Show product in use
- Behind-the-scenes content
- Batch film — one day filming = one week content

**Content types that work:**
- Product reveals / unboxings
- Day in the life of founder
- POV using product
- Packing orders (social proof)
- Customer reactions
- Trending format + your product

**How to get views:**
- First 100 views determine viral potential
- Watch time is king (keep them watching)
- Reply to every comment (engagement signal)
- Post when your audience is active (test 8am, 12pm, 6pm)

### Instagram Reels
- Repurpose TikTok content (remove watermark)
- Hashtags: 5-10 relevant, mix of sizes
- Engage in DMs — conversations convert
- Stories: daily, behind-the-scenes, polls

### Pinterest (Underrated for DTC)
- Create pins for every product
- Rich pins with pricing
- Join group boards
- Pin consistently (5-20/day with Tailwind)
- Works great for: home, beauty, fashion, gifts

### Facebook Groups
- Find groups where your customer hangs out
- GIVE value for 2 weeks before mentioning product
- Answer questions, be helpful
- When you post, it's "I made this thing that solves X"
- NOT spamming your link

---

## Phase 3: Build Email List ($0-50/month)

### Why Email Matters More Than Ads at This Stage
- You OWN the list (no algorithm changes)
- Free to send (Klaviyo free up to 250 subs)
- 25-40% of revenue for mature brands

### How to Get First 500 Subscribers

**1. Website popup (essential)**
- Offer: 10-15% discount or free resource
- Trigger: After 5 seconds or exit intent
- Expected conversion: 2-5% of visitors

**2. Organic social → email**
- "Link in bio" to landing page with email capture
- Lead magnet related to your niche
- Examples: guide, checklist, quiz

**3. Giveaway (fastest growth)**
- Use Gleam, Viral Loops, or KingSumo
- Partner with complementary brand
- Require email + follows
- Prize = your product + partner products
- Can add 100-500 emails in one giveaway

**4. Friends & family**
- Literally ask 50 people you know
- "I'm starting a business, can you join my email list?"
- These first subscribers provide early feedback

### First 3 Emails to Write
1. **Welcome email:** Thank you, brand story, discount code, what to expect
2. **Social proof email:** Reviews, testimonials, customer photos
3. **Abandoned cart email:** Reminder + reason to buy now

## Phase 4: Micro-Budget Ads ($10-20/day)

### When to Start Paid Ads
- 100+ email subscribers
- 3+ organic sales (proves product sells)
- Clear understanding of who your customer is
- Margins support 30%+ ad spend

### $10/Day Meta Strategy

**Campaign setup:**
- 1 CBO campaign
- 3 ad sets:
  - Broad targeting (no interests)
  - Interest stack #1 (3-5 relevant interests)
  - Lookalike 1% of email list (if 100+ emails)

**Creative:**
- 2-3 video ads (repurpose TikTok content)
- 1-2 static images
- Same creative across all ad sets

**Optimization:**
- Conversion objective (Purchase)
- Day 1-3: Learning phase, don't touch
- Day 4-7: Kill any ad set with $0 revenue
- Week 2: Add new creative to winners

### What "Working" Looks Like at This Budget
- You're NOT looking for profit
- Goal: Acquire data and customers at break-even
- CPA should be < your contribution margin
- If losing less than $5/day while getting sales → keep going

### Red Flags to Pause
- Zero add-to-carts after $20 spend
- CTR below 0.5% (creative isn't working)
- CPM over $20 (targeting too narrow)

## Phase 5: Influencer Seeding ($0-200)

### Free Influencer Strategy (Gifting)
Better ROI than ads at small scale.

**How to do it:**
1. Find 50 nano/micro creators (1K-50K followers) in your niche
2. DM each personally (not copy/paste)
3. Offer free product in exchange for honest post
4. 10-20% will accept
5. 50% of those will actually post
6. Use their content for ads (ask permission)

**DM Template:**
"Hey [Name], I've been following your content and love your [specific post]. I just launched [product] and think it'd be perfect for your style. Would you be open to trying it out? Happy to send one your way, no strings attached. Let me know! - [Your name]"

**Track results:**
- Unique discount code per influencer
- UTM links
- Note: most value is in content, not direct sales

---

## Pricing for Beginners

### How to Set Your Price

**Step 1: Know your costs**
- Product cost (COGS)
- Shipping cost
- Payment processing (2.9% + $0.30)
- Platform fees (if any)
- Total = True Cost

**Step 2: Target 3-4x markup**
- COGS $10 → Price $30-40
- This gives you room for:
  - 30% marketing
  - 20-30% contribution margin
  - Discounts when needed

**Step 3: Sanity check**
- What do competitors charge?
- What would YOU pay?
- Is it below $30? (impulse buy threshold)
- Is it above $100? (considered purchase — need more trust)

### Free Shipping Strategy
- Calculate average order
- Add shipping cost into product price
- Or: Set threshold at 30% above AOV
- "Free shipping over $X" converts better than "$5 flat rate"

## Should I Use Facebook or TikTok?

### Decision Tree

**Start with TikTok if:**
- Your product is visual/demo-friendly
- Target audience is under 40
- You can create content yourself
- You have zero ad budget (organic first)

**Start with Meta if:**
- You have $500+/month ad budget
- Target audience is 30+
- You have existing creative/UGC
- You need retargeting (website has traffic)

**Start with Google if:**
- People actively search for your product type
- You have $1K+/month budget
- Your product isn't impulse-buy
- Competitors are running Google Shopping

### Channel Progression
Most successful path:
1. TikTok organic → prove content works
2. Meta ads → test paid, build lookalikes
3. TikTok ads → scale what worked organically
4. Google Shopping → capture high-intent search
5. Email/SMS → retain and repeat

## Common Beginner Mistakes

### Don't Do This
- ❌ Spending $500 on logo before sales
- ❌ Building elaborate website for months
- ❌ Running ads before any organic sales
- ❌ Copying successful brand's strategy at 1% their scale
- ❌ Ordering 5,000 units before proving demand
- ❌ Giving up after 2 weeks of no sales
- ❌ Discounting immediately to "get sales"

### Do This Instead
- ✅ Ugly store that converts > beautiful store that doesn't
- ✅ 10 sales prove more than 10 friends' opinions
- ✅ Content is free, ads cost money
- ✅ Start with what you have
- ✅ Test small before ordering big
- ✅ Give yourself 90 days minimum

---

## Realistic Timeline

### Month 1
- 0-10 sales (mostly friends, organic, random)
- Building content library
- Finding what resonates
- Learning platform algorithms

### Month 2
- 10-30 sales
- First consistent traffic source
- Email list growing
- Starting micro-budget ads

### Month 3
- 30-100 sales
- Understanding unit economics
- Scaling what works
- Cutting what doesn't

### Month 4-6
- Predictable revenue
- CAC stabilizing
- Repeat customers appearing
- Ready to scale

**Reality:** Most successful DTC brands took 6-12 months to hit consistent profitability. The ones who "blew up overnight" had years of prep or got lucky — don't compare your day 30 to their year 3.
