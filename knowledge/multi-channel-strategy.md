# Multi-Channel Strategy: Running DTC + Amazon + TikTok Shop

## Why Multi-Channel Matters

### The Numbers
- Brands selling on 3+ channels see 150-190% higher revenue
- 73% of shoppers use multiple channels during purchase journey
- Amazon captures 40%+ of US ecom, ignoring it leaves money on table
- TikTok Shop grew 200%+ in 2024-2025

### The Risk of Single-Channel
- Algorithm changes (iOS14 killed many DTC brands)
- Platform policy changes (TikTok bans, Amazon suspensions)
- Competition increases (rising CPMs everywhere)
- Customer preferences shift

## Channel Roles: Play to Strengths

### Amazon: The Volume Engine
**Best for:**
- New customer acquisition via search
- Social proof (reviews build credibility everywhere)
- Mainstream/mass market products
- Products people search for by type

**Not great for:**
- Brand building (customers think "I bought on Amazon")
- Customer data collection
- Unique/premium positioning
- Low-margin products (fees eat profit)

### DTC (Shopify): The Profit Engine
**Best for:**
- Highest margins
- Full customer data ownership
- Brand experience control
- Email/SMS list building
- Subscription revenue

**Not great for:**
- Cold traffic acquisition (expensive)
- Building initial trust (no built-in reviews)
- Casual browsers

### TikTok Shop: The Discovery Engine
**Best for:**
- Viral product launches
- Trending/impulse products
- Building brand awareness
- Younger demographics (18-34)
- Visual/demo-friendly products

**Not great for:**
- Search-driven products
- Complex/high-consideration purchases
- Older demographics
- Products requiring trust/warranty

## Pricing Strategy Across Channels

### Option 1: Parity Pricing (Same Everywhere)
**Pros:**
- Simple to manage
- No customer confusion
- Meets Amazon's pricing parity requirements

**Cons:**
- Amazon fees eat more margin
- Can't optimize per channel

**When to use:**
- You have MAP policy
- Customers cross-shop aggressively
- Brand perception matters

### Option 2: Amazon Premium
Price Amazon 5-15% higher to offset fees.

**Justification to customers:**
- Prime shipping value
- Amazon's customer service
- Returns ease

**Execution:**
- DTC: $29.99
- Amazon: $34.99 (Prime "free" shipping baked in)

**Risk:**
- Amazon may flag for pricing parity
- Customers who price compare may prefer DTC (good!)

### Option 3: Channel-Specific SKUs
Create slightly different products/bundles per channel.

**Examples:**
- Amazon: Standard 30-day supply
- DTC: "Starter Kit" with bonus samples
- TikTok Shop: Viral "Mini" size for impulse

**Why this works:**
- No direct price comparison
- Optimize each product for channel strengths
- Test different price points

## Inventory Strategy

### Allocation Framework

**Conservative (cash-tight):**
- 60% FBA (Amazon)
- 40% 3PL/DTC
- TikTok Shop: Fulfilled from DTC 3PL

**Aggressive (growth mode):**
- 50% FBA
- 30% 3PL/DTC
- 20% TikTok Shop (if FBT available)

### Avoiding Stockouts
- Maintain 8-12 weeks inventory per channel
- Factor in Amazon's inbound shipping times (2-4 weeks to receive)
- Use reorder alerts across all channels
- Never run dry on best-sellers — kills ranking everywhere

### Overstock Management
- Clearance on DTC first (best margins)
- Then TikTok Shop flash sale
- Amazon Outlet/Lightning Deals last resort

## Traffic & Customer Journey

### Ideal Customer Flows

### Driving Cross-Channel
**Amazon → DTC:**

- QR code to SMS signup

**TikTok → DTC/Amazon:**
- Link in bio to landing page
- Use linktree-style page to let customer choose

## Avoiding Cannibalization

### When Channels Compete
Signs of cannibalization:
- DTC sales drop when Amazon launches
- Total revenue stays flat despite new channel
- Customers complaining about price differences

### Prevention Strategies

**1. Differentiate the Value Proposition**
- Amazon: Convenience, Prime shipping
- DTC: Exclusives, bundles, subscription savings
- TikTok: Trending, limited drops

**2. Control the Offer**
- Amazon: Standard products
- DTC: Subscribe & save (15% off)
- TikTok: Impulse kits

**3. Segment the Customer**
- Search-first buyers → Amazon
- Brand-aware customers → DTC
- Social discovery → TikTok

**4. Use Halo Effect**
- Amazon reviews boost DTC conversion
- TikTok content drives Amazon search
- DTC brand strength = Amazon premium tolerance
