## Key Formulas

### Break-Even ROAS
```
Break-Even ROAS = 1 / Contribution Margin %
Example: 30% margin = 3.33 ROAS needed
```

### Marketing Efficiency Ratio (MER)
```
MER = Total Revenue / Total Marketing Spend
Target: 3-5x
```

### Blended CAC
```
Blended CAC = Total Marketing Spend / Total New Customers
(Includes organic + paid)
```

### Customer Lifetime Value
```
LTV = AOV × Purchase Frequency × Customer Lifespan
Example: $75 × 3 purchases/year × 2 years = $450 LTV
```

### Payback Period
```
Payback Period = CAC / (AOV × Contribution Margin %)
Target: Under 6 months
```

## Diagnostic Frameworks

### When ROAS Drops Suddenly
Check in this order:
1. **Creative fatigue** (most common) - ads over 2 weeks old lose effectiveness
2. **Audience saturation** - frequency above 2.5 means you've shown ads too many times
3. **Seasonal CPM spikes** - Q4, holidays, elections drive up costs
4. **Tracking issues** - pixel broken, CAPI misconfigured
5. **Landing page problems** - page speed, checkout issues
6. **Competitor activity** - new entrant bidding on your audiences

Immediate actions:
- Launch 5-10 new creatives TODAY
- Check frequency in ad manager
- Verify pixel is firing correctly
- Test landing page speed (under 3 seconds)

### When CAC Keeps Rising
1. Channel saturation - you've maxed out efficient spend
2. Creative is stale - same ads for 30+ days
3. Attribution is broken - Meta claiming organic sales
4. Market is more competitive
5. Your offer is weak vs competitors

Solutions:
- Diversify to new channels (TikTok, Google, influencer)
- Refresh creative every 2-3 weeks
- Implement server-side tracking (CAPI)
- Test new offers and bundles
- Consider incrementality testing

### Attribution Reality Check
Meta and Google both over-attribute. Here's why your channel ROAS doesn't match blended MER:

**The Over-Attribution Problem:**
- Meta claims conversions from people who would have bought anyway
- View-through attribution gives credit for seeing an ad, even without clicking
- Same customer gets attributed to multiple channels

**How to diagnose:**
- Compare platform-reported ROAS to blended MER
- If gap is >30%, attribution is inflating results
- Run holdout tests: turn off ads in one geo, measure impact
- Use post-purchase surveys: "How did you hear about us?"

**iOS14/ATT Impact:**
- 60-70% of iOS users opted out of tracking
- Meta can only see ~30% of conversions
- Platform-reported ROAS is usually 30-50% higher than reality

### Cash Flow Reality Check

**CRITICAL: Cash to Revenue Ratio**
- $50k cash on $150k/month revenue = DANGER (only 10 days of expenses)
- Healthy ratio: Cash should equal 2-3 months of COGS minimum
- At $150k/month with 40% COGS, you need $120k+ cash to be safe

**Danger zones:**
- Less than 8 weeks of inventory + expenses = critical
- Cash tied up in inventory can't pay for ads
- Scaling ads too fast = cash crunch
- Running out of cash kills more DTC brands than bad marketing

**Safe cash runway calculation:**
```
Monthly burn = COGS + Marketing + Fixed costs
Safe runway = 3-4 months of burn minimum
Example: $150k revenue, 40% COGS, 30% marketing
  COGS = $60k, Marketing = $45k, Fixed = $15k
  Monthly burn = $120k
  Safe cash = $360k minimum
```

**Before scaling, ensure:**
- 12+ weeks of inventory on hand or on order
- 60+ days of cash runway after inventory
- Payment terms with suppliers (net 30-60)
- Never scale ads if it will drain cash below 60 days runway

**If cash is tight:**
- Focus on retention (free) over acquisition (costs money)
- Negotiate longer payment terms with suppliers
- Consider inventory financing (Clearco, Wayflyer)
- Slow down ad scaling until cash improves

## Subscription Business Specifics

### Subscription Retention Curve
Typical churn pattern:
- Month 1: 5-10% (immediate regret)
- Month 2-3: 15-20% (the cliff - didn't see value)
- Month 4-6: 10-12% (stabilizing)
- Month 7+: 5-8% (loyal base)

**The Month 2-3 Cliff:**
This is where most churn happens. Causes:
- Product didn't meet expectations
- Forgot why they subscribed
- Didn't use/need the product

**How to fix the cliff:**
- Onboarding email sequence explaining value
- Check-in at day 20 asking for feedback
- Surprise gift in box 2 or 3
- Personalization based on preferences

### Subscription Benchmarks
- Healthy monthly churn: 8-12%
- Average subscriber lifespan: 6-12 months
- Subscriber LTV should be 4-6x first box value
- Acquisition cost recovery: within first 2 boxes

### Reducing Subscription Churn
High-impact tactics:
1. **Surprise and delight** - unexpected bonus items
2. **Skip flexibility** - let them pause without canceling
3. **Personalization** - customize based on feedback
4. **Community** - exclusive subscriber group
5. **Commitment discounts** - annual plan at 20% off

Red flags to investigate:
- Churn spikes after specific box number
- Higher churn in certain cohorts
- Complaints about shipping/quality

## Creative Strategy Deep Dive

### Creative Fatigue Signs
- CTR drops below 1% (was higher)
- CPM stays same but CPC rises
- Frequency above 2.5

### Creative Testing Framework
**Volume:** Test 10+ new creatives per week
**Types to test:**
- UGC (user-generated content) - highest performer for most brands
- Founder story / behind the scenes
- Product demo / how-to
- Social proof / testimonials
- Problem-agitation-solution

**Hook framework (first 3 seconds):**
- Pattern interrupt - unexpected visual or statement
- Question - "Are you still using X?"
- Bold claim - "This replaced my entire routine"
- Transformation - before/after

### Creative Production at Scale
- Build a UGC creator network (10-20 creators)
- Batch shoot content monthly
- Repurpose long-form into short clips
- A/B test hooks while keeping body same
- Kill losers fast (no conversions after $50-100 spend)
