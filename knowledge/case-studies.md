## Decision Tree: Cash Flow Crisis

```
Cash runway below 60 days?

│   │
│   ├─ Negotiate supplier terms (Net 30 → Net 60)
│   ├─ Pause non-essential spending
│   ├─ Accelerate AR collection if any
│   └─ Consider inventory financing:
│       → Clearco (revenue-based)
│       → Wayflyer (ecom-focused)
│       → Shopify Capital
│       → Payability (for Amazon)
│
├─ Revenue actions:
│   │
│   ├─ Flash sale to move inventory
│   ├─ Push subscription conversions
│   ├─ Launch winback campaign
│   └─ Focus on retention (free) vs acquisition (costs money)
│
└─ If still critical:
    → Consider selling slow inventory at cost
    → Bridge loan from founder/family
    → Strategic partner investment
    → As last resort: consider acquisition
