# Expert Channel Strategies

## Amazon Expansion Decision Framework

### When Amazon Makes Sense
- You have excess inventory to liquidate
- Your product is commoditized (people search for category, not brand)
- You want to test product-market fit cheaply
- You're in a category where Amazon dominates discovery (supplements, home goods)
- You have products that benefit from Prime shipping expectations

### When Amazon Doesn't Make Sense
- Your brand IS the value prop (premium positioning)
- Your margins can't handle 15-30% Amazon fees
- You rely on customer data for retention/remarketing
- Your product requires education (Amazon listings are limited)
- You're not prepared to compete on reviews

### The Real Math on Amazon
**Amazon Fees Stack:**
- Referral fee: 8-15% (category dependent)
- FBA fees: $3-5+ per unit (size dependent)
- Advertising (required to compete): 15-25% of revenue
- Returns (higher than DTC): 5-15%

**Net margin comparison:**
- DTC at 60% contribution → Amazon at 25-35% contribution
- You're trading margin for volume

### 1P vs 3P Decision
**Vendor Central (1P):**
- Amazon buys inventory from you at wholesale
- They control pricing, marketing, content
- Predictable purchase orders
- Loss of brand control
- Best for: High-volume, commodity products

**Seller Central (3P):**
- You sell directly to customers
- You control pricing and content
- More work, more control
- Must compete for Buy Box
- Best for: Branded products, premium positioning

### Hybrid Strategy (Recommended)
- Keep hero products DTC-only (protect margin and brand)
- Put accessory products on Amazon (lower margin okay)
- Use Amazon for closeouts and excess inventory
- Use Amazon data to validate new product ideas
- Never let Amazon exceed 30% of total revenue

### Protecting Your Brand on Amazon
- Enroll in Brand Registry (requires trademark)
- Create A+ Content (enhanced listings)
- Set up MAP pricing agreements
- Monitor and report counterfeiters
- Build review velocity before competitors

## TikTok Strategy Deep Dive

### TikTok Ads vs Meta Ads
| Factor | TikTok | Meta |
|--------|--------|------|
| Creative lifespan | 7-14 days | 14-30 days |
| CPM | Lower ($5-10) | Higher ($10-20) |
| Hook timing | 0.5-1 second | 2-3 seconds |
| Best format | Native UGC | Polished + UGC |
| Attribution | Worse | Better |
| Scale ceiling | Lower (for now) | Higher |

### TikTok Creative That Converts
**The Non-Negotiables:**
1. Hook in first 0.5 seconds (not 3 like Meta)
2. Native look (not polished ads)
3. Use trending sounds when relevant
4. Text overlays for silent viewing
5. Face in first frame (3x higher retention)

**Best Performing Formats:**
1. "I was today years old when I learned..." (discovery hook)
2. POV videos (day in my life using product)
3. Before/after transformations
4. Unpacking/unboxing reactions
5. Duet/stitch of skeptic converting
6. "Things TikTok made me buy" listicle

### TikTok Shop vs TikTok Ads
**TikTok Shop:**
- Users buy without leaving app
- Higher conversion (less friction)
- TikTok takes 5% commission + payment fees
- Requires different operations (returns, fulfillment)
- Best for impulse-buy products under $50

**TikTok Ads to Website:**
- Standard attribution challenges
- Higher AOV possible
- Keep customer data
- Retargeting capability
- Best for considered purchases, subscriptions

### Spark Ads Explained
Spark Ads = Boosting organic posts (yours or creators')
- Comments and engagement stay on original post
- Higher trust (looks organic)
- Can use any creator's post with permission
- Best for awareness and consideration

**Spark Ads Best Practices:**
- Identify posts going viral organically
- Boost within 24-48 hours of posting
- Budget: Start at $50-100/day per post
- Let it run 3-5 days minimum
- Scale winners to $500+/day

## Building an Influencer Army (100+ Creators)

### The Pyramid Model
```
Tier 1: Brand Ambassadors (5-10)
- Long-term contracts (6-12 months)
- Exclusive or first-look rights
- $2,000-10,000/month retainer
- 2-4 posts per month
- Deep brand integration

Tier 2: Regular Partners (20-50)
- Monthly or quarterly arrangements
- $500-2,000 per post
- 1-2 posts per month
- Flexible terms

Tier 3: Gifting/Affiliate (100-500)
- Free product only
- Affiliate commission (15-25%)
- No posting obligation
- Volume play
```

### Finding Creators at Scale
**Manual Search:**
- Search hashtags in your niche
- Look at competitor partnerships
- Check who's tagging similar brands
- Search "[category] creator" or "[category] influencer"

**Platforms:**
- Grin ($$$) - Full suite, best for 50+ creators
- CreatorIQ ($$$) - Enterprise level
- Insense ($$) - UGC focused, affordable
- Aspire ($) - Good for startups
- Hashtag Paid ($) - Budget option
- TikTok Creator Marketplace (free) - Direct from TikTok

### Outreach That Works
**DM Template (higher response than email):**
"Hey [Name]! Love your content, especially [specific post]. We're [Brand] and I think you'd genuinely love [Product]. Would you be open to trying it? No strings attached - just think it's right up your alley. LMK! 🙌"

**Key Principles:**
- Personalize with specific content reference
- Lead with gift, not ask
- Keep it casual (not corporate)
- DM > Email for response rate
- Follow up once after 5-7 days

### The Gifting Funnel
```
Send product to 100 creators
↓
30-40 will post organically (30-40%)
↓
10-15 will perform well (10-15%)
↓
5-10 become ongoing partners (5-10%)
↓
1-2 become brand ambassadors
```

**Gifting Program Operations:**
- Use a tracking spreadsheet or platform
- Include handwritten note + clear CTA
- No posting requirement (reduces pressure)
- Follow up for feedback even if no post
- Track who posts, engagement, sales driven
- Invite top performers to paid partnerships

### Creator Compensation Benchmarks
**By Follower Count:**
- Nano (1k-10k): Product only or $50-150
- Micro (10k-50k): $150-500 per post
- Mid (50k-200k): $500-2,000 per post
- Macro (200k-1M): $2,000-10,000 per post
- Mega (1M+): $10,000+ per post

**By Content Type:**
- Static post: Base rate
- Video/Reel: 1.5-2x base
- Story only: 0.3-0.5x base
- Story + Post: 1.3x base
- Whitelisting/usage rights: +25-50%

### UGC Rights Negotiation
**Always Negotiate Upfront:**
- Organic use only vs. paid ads
- Duration (30/60/90 days, perpetual)
- Platforms (TikTok only vs. all platforms)
- Exclusivity (can they post for competitors?)

**Standard Terms:**
- Organic posting: Usually included
- Paid ads (30 days): +25% of fee
- Paid ads (perpetual): +50-100% of fee
- Exclusivity (category): +50-100% of fee

### Measuring Influencer ROI
**Direct Attribution:**
- Unique discount codes per creator
- UTM links in bio/comments
- Post-purchase survey "how did you hear about us?"
- Influencer-specific landing pages

**Indirect Value:**
- Brand search lift during campaign
- Social following growth
- Earned media mentions
- Content for paid ads (often most valuable)

**Benchmarks:**
- Expect 2-5x ROI on total spend (including product)
- CPM through influencers: $5-15 (efficient)
- Conversion rate from influencer traffic: 2-5%

## Channel Diversification Framework

### The 60/20/20 Rule
At scale ($500k+/month), target:
- 60% from 1-2 primary paid channels
- 20% from owned channels (email, SMS)
- 20% from emerging/other (influencer, organic, Amazon)

### When to Add Each Channel

**TikTok Ads:**
- Add when: You have UGC that's working on Meta
- Budget to start: $3-5k/month
- Timeline to evaluate: 60-90 days
- Signs it's working: CPM under $10, CVR above 1%

**Google Ads:**
- Add when: You have brand search volume
- Budget to start: $5-10k/month
- Start with: Brand + Shopping campaigns
- Add Non-brand search at $20k+ spend

**Amazon:**
- Add when: $250k+/month DTC, commodity product
- Investment to start: $10-20k (inventory + setup)
- Timeline to evaluate: 6-12 months
- Expect profitability: Month 6-12

**YouTube:**
- Add when: You have video content working elsewhere
- Budget to start: $10-20k/month (higher minimums)
- Best for: Awareness, retargeting, branded search lift
- Harder to get direct response

**Pinterest:**
- Add when: Visual product + female audience
- Budget to start: $2-5k/month
- Best for: Home, fashion, beauty, food, wedding
- Long purchase cycle (save → consider → buy)

### Incrementality Testing
Before scaling any channel, test incrementality:
1. Run geo holdout (turn off ads in 10-20% of regions)
2. Compare sales in holdout vs. active regions
3. True incremental lift = Difference in conversion rates
4. Most brands find Meta is 50-70% incremental (not 100%)

### Channel Death Spiral Signs
Time to cut/reduce a channel:
- CAC 2x above target for 30+ days
- Spend increasing but revenue flat
- Can't find winning creative after 10+ tests
- ROAS below 1.5x for 60+ days
- Better returns elsewhere
