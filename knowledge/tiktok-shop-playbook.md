## SECTION 7: Platform Fees & Economics

### Fee Structure
- Seller fees, commissions vary by market
- Heavy discounting common (margin compression for reach)
- Fulfillment/logistics critical to conversion
- Easy returns = better retention

**Source:** Marketing LTB

### Key Economics
- Low AOV, high volume model
- Promotional GMV can be ephemeral without retention strategy
- Algorithmic reach requires novelty (creative refresh critical)

---

## SECTION 8: Tactical Playbook

### For Sellers
1. **Expect low AOV** — use bundles/upsells to raise cart value
2. **Livestream for conversion** — measure GMV per minute/viewer
3. **Creative refresh** — CTR/CR per creative determines efficiency
4. **Fast fulfillment** — local logistics = better conversion
5. **Price testing** — test elasticity aggressively
6. **Retention focus** — subscriptions, membership offers

### For Affiliate Strategy
1. Start with 15-20% commission for Open Collaborations
2. Offer 25-30% for top performers (Targeted Collaborations)
3. Use Shop Ads commission rate for paid amplification
4. Target micro-influencers (<50K) for highest engagement
5. Provide creators with product samples + talking points

### Content Strategy
1. Short-form video = 58% of sales (prioritize this)
2. Demo-friendly products outperform
3. Before/after transformations crush
4. UGC and social proof drive conversion
5. Localize content for each market

---

## SECTION 9: Risks & Considerations

- Regulatory scrutiny (data, national security)
- Heavy discounting erodes margins
- Logistics/returns costs for low-AOV items
- Algorithmic dependence (paid amplification often needed)
- Competition from Instagram, YouTube shopping features
