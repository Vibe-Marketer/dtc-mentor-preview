# Expert DTC Playbooks (Chase Dimond, Nik Sharma, Nick Shackelford Level)

## Chase Dimond's Email Framework

### The Revenue Split Target
- **30-40% of total revenue from email** (owned channels)
- If below 25%, you're leaving money on the table
- If above 50%, your acquisition is broken

### The 8 Essential Flows (Priority Order)
1. **Welcome Series** (40-60% of flow revenue)
2. **Abandoned Cart** (15-25% of flow revenue)
3. **Browse Abandonment** (5-10% of flow revenue)
4. **Post-Purchase** (builds LTV)
5. **Winback** (re-engage lapsed customers)
6. **Sunset** (clean your list)
7. **VIP/Loyalty** (reward best customers)
8. **Replenishment** (for consumables)

### Welcome Series Best Practices
**Timing:**
- Email 1: Immediate (deliver incentive)
- Email 2: 24 hours (founder story)
- Email 3: 48 hours (social proof)
- Email 4: 72 hours (education/value)
- Email 5: 5-7 days (final push)

**Conversion Triggers:**
- Remove from flow once they purchase
- Split by engagement (openers vs non-openers)
- Different paths for discount users vs non-discount

### Abandoned Cart Framework
**The 3-Email Sequence:**

Email 1 (1 hour): "Helpful" angle
- Subject: Make it about THEM, not the cart
- Copy: Assume something went wrong
- No discount
- Goal: Handle technical objections

Email 2 (24 hours): "Social proof" angle
- Subject: Curiosity or benefit
- Copy: Address objections with testimonials
- Include guarantee/return policy
- Still no discount (unless high-value cart)

Email 3 (48 hours): "Urgency" angle
- Subject: Scarcity or deadline
- Copy: Final chance + incentive
- Include discount if your margins allow
- Cart expiration deadline

**Advanced Tactics:**
- Different sequences for cart value ($50 vs $150 vs $300)
- Different sequences for first-time vs repeat customers
- Different sequences by product category
- Resend to non-openers with new subject line (24h after Email 3)

### Subject Line Rules (Chase Dimond)
1. **Curiosity > Clarity** for cold audiences
2. **Benefit > Feature** always
3. **Personalization increases opens 20-30%**
4. **Emoji use: test it, usually 1 max**
5. **Length: 30-50 characters optimal**
6. **Lowercase can outperform Title Case**

**Subject Lines That Work:**
- "your skin called..." (curiosity)
- "[Name], this sold out last time" (personalization + scarcity)
- "the email I didn't want to send" (intrigue)
- "72 hours left" (urgency, simple)
- "we need to talk about [product]" (conversation)

**Subject Lines That Don't Work:**
- "Don't forget!" (overused, ignored)
- "Your cart is waiting" (boring, everyone uses it)
- "SALE! BIG DISCOUNT INSIDE!" (spam trigger)
- "Quick question" (feels like a trick)

## Nik Sharma's DTC Philosophy

### The Unit Economics Obsession
**Know these numbers cold:**
- CAC by channel (not blended)
- Contribution margin (not gross margin)
- Payback period in days
- LTV at 90, 180, 365 days
- LTV:CAC ratio by cohort

**Nik's Rule:** If you can't recite these numbers from memory, you're not running a real business.

### Retention is the Game
"Acquisition is rented. Retention is owned."

**The Retention Stack:**
1. Email flows (non-negotiable)
2. SMS (15-20% of owned channel revenue)
3. Loyalty program (increase LTV 20-30%)
4. Subscription (for consumables, 40-60% of revenue)
5. Community (brand moat)

### Brand + Performance = DTC
"Brand without performance is art. Performance without brand is arbitrage."

**How to build both:**
- Every ad should feel like content
- Every email should feel like a friend
- Your brand voice is your moat
- Consistency across every touchpoint

### Subscription Strategy
**When to add subscriptions:**
- Consumable product (must-have)
- 30-90 day natural repurchase cycle
- Clear value prop for subscribing (not just discount)

**Subscription economics:**
- Target: 40-60% of orders on subscription
- Acceptable churn: 8-12% monthly
- Average subscriber lifespan: 6-12 months
- Subscription LTV should be 3-4x one-time buyer

**Making subscriptions work:**
- Don't lead with "save 15%" - lead with convenience
- Make skip/pause EASY (reduces cancel)
- Pre-delivery emails build anticipation
- Surprise bonuses for long-term subscribers

## Nick Shackelford's Creative Framework

### Creative is the New Targeting
"In 2024+, the algorithm finds your audience. Your creative determines who that is."

### The 3-2-2 Testing Method
Every week launch:
- **3 new hooks** (first 3 seconds)
- **2 new body variations** (middle content)
- **2 new CTAs** (end card/offer)

Mix and match to create 12 variations minimum.

### What Makes Creative Work
**The Hook (0-3 seconds):**
- Stop the scroll immediately
- Pattern interrupt (unexpected visual/audio)
- Call out your audience ("Struggling with acne?")
- Start mid-action (unboxing, applying product)

**The Body (4-30 seconds):**
- Problem → Solution → Proof
- Show the product in use
- Feature real customers, not models
- Keep movement constant (no static shots)

**The CTA (last 5 seconds):**
- Clear, simple instruction
- Reinforce the offer
- Create urgency if authentic

### UGC That Converts
**The Formula:**
"Hook (pain point) → Discovery (found this product) → Experience (using it) → Result (transformation) → CTA (you should try it)"

**UGC Briefing Essentials:**
- Shoot vertical (9:16)
- Natural lighting
- No script reading (bullet points only)
- Show the product within 3 seconds
- Keep it under 45 seconds
- Multiple takes of each section

### Scaling Winners
**When to scale:**
- 3+ days of consistent performance
- At least $500 in spend
- CPA at or below target
- Frequency under 2.5

**How to scale:**
- Duplicate winning ad sets (not increase budget)
- 20% budget increase max if you must increase
- Launch in new campaign (don't touch winner)
- Test same creative to new audiences

**6. Direct Benefit Hook:**

## Campaign Strategy

### Monthly Email Calendar
**Week 1:** Educational content + soft sell
**Week 2:** Social proof heavy (reviews, UGC)
**Week 3:** Promotional (limited offer)
**Week 4:** Community/brand building

### Campaign Types That Work
1. **New Product Launch:** Tease → Reveal → Social proof → Last chance
2. **Flash Sale:** 24-48 hours max, clear deadline
3. **Restock Alert:** "Back in stock" performs 2-3x normal campaigns
4. **Behind the Scenes:** Founder stories, process videos
5. **User Spotlight:** Customer transformations, reviews
6. **Educational:** How to use product, ingredient deep dives

### Resend Strategy
For important campaigns:
- Wait 24-48 hours
- Resend to NON-OPENERS only
- New subject line (completely different angle)
- Expected: 50-70% of original opens
