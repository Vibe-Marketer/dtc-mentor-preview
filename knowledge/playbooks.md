# DTC Playbooks - Deep Tactical Knowledge

## Email Copy Frameworks

### Welcome Email 1 - The Hook (Send immediately)
**Subject lines that work:**
- "Welcome to [Brand] - here's what happens next"
- "You're in. Here's your [X]% off"
- "[First name], let's get started"

**Structure:**
1. Thank them for joining
2. One sentence brand story (why you exist)
3. What to expect from emails (frequency, value)
4. Clear CTA - shop now with welcome discount
5. P.S. with urgency (discount expires in 48hrs)

**Benchmarks:**
- Open rate target: 50-60%
- Click rate target: 8-15%
- If below these, your subject line or offer is weak

### Abandoned Cart Email Sequence

**Email 1 (1 hour after abandon)**
Subject: "Did something go wrong?"
- Assume technical issue, not cold feet
- Show cart contents with images
- Single CTA: Complete your order
- NO discount yet

**Email 2 (24 hours)**
Subject: "Still thinking about [Product]?"
- Add social proof (reviews, testimonials)
- Address common objections
- Show shipping/return policy
- Still no discount

**Email 3 (48 hours)**
Subject: "Last chance + [X]% off"
- Create urgency (cart expires)
- Add small discount (10-15%)
- Final push with scarcity
- "Only [X] left in stock"

**Benchmarks:**
- Email 1: 40%+ open rate
- Email 2: 35%+ open rate
- Email 3: 30%+ open rate
- Overall cart recovery: 10-15%

## Ad Creative Frameworks

### UGC Script Template - Problem/Solution
```
Hook (0-3 sec): "I was struggling with [problem]..."
Problem (3-10 sec): Agitate the pain point
Discovery (10-15 sec): "Then I found [Brand]"
Solution (15-25 sec): Show product in use
Results (25-35 sec): Transformation/outcome
CTA (35-40 sec): "Click the link to try it"
```

### UGC Script Template - Unboxing
```
Hook (0-3 sec): "My [Brand] order just arrived!"
Unboxing (3-15 sec): Open package, show contents
First impressions (15-25 sec): React to quality/smell/feel
Try it on/use it (25-40 sec): Show product in action
Verdict (40-50 sec): "I'm obsessed, link in bio"
```

### Static Ad Framework
- Hero image: Product in use (not just product shot)
- Headline: Benefit, not feature (what they GET)
- Body: 3 bullet points max
- Social proof: Star rating + review count
- CTA: Action-oriented (Shop Now, Get Yours, Try It)
- Urgency: Optional but effective (Limited stock, Sale ends)

### Headlines That Convert
- "The [Product] that [Celebrity/Influencer] swears by"
- "Finally, a [Product] that actually works"
- "[Number] women switched to [Brand] last month"
- "Why [Target audience] are obsessed with [Product]"
- "The [Product] your [skin/hair/body] has been waiting for"
