## Supplements & Vitamins

### The Subscription Machine Model
Supplements are THE subscription category. If you're not subscription-first, you're leaving 70% of LTV on the table.

**Subscription conversion tactics:**
- Pre-select subscription on PDP (10-15% lift)
- Show per-serving cost not per-bottle ($1.50/day vs $45/month)
- "Never run out" messaging > "Save 15%"
- Auto-ship with flexible dates (not locked)
- Skip/pause prominent in account portal

**Benchmark targets:**
- Subscription rate: 40-60% of orders
- Monthly churn: 8-12%
- Average subscriber life: 6-8 months
- Subscriber LTV: 3-4x one-time buyer

**Top converting offers:**
1. First month 50% off, then full price (aggressive but works)
2. Free gift with subscription (shaker, pill case)
3. Subscribe & save 20% + free shipping
4. 90-day money back guarantee (de-risks trial)

**Critical flows:**
- Pre-delivery reminder (2 days before charge)
- "Your shipment is coming" excitement builder
- Post-delivery check-in (Day 3)
- Results tracking email (Day 14, 30)
- Replenishment reminder for one-time buyers (Day 25)

### Compliance Essentials
- No disease claims ("cures", "treats", "prevents")

- Disclaimer required: "These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA"
- Testimonials must be typical results
- Before/after requires substantiation
